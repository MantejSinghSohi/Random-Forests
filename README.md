# Random-Forests
Boston Housing and Breast Cancer Analysis
This project implements a Random Forest Regressor for predicting housing prices using the Boston Housing dataset and an AdaBoost Classifier for predicting breast cancer outcomes using the Breast Cancer dataset. The project involves data preparation, model training with hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation. The Random Forest model is optimized using GridSearchCV for the number of trees and maximum depth, while the AdaBoost model is implemented from scratch and compared against scikit-learn's AdaBoostClassifier.
